# Algorithm 1: Exhaustive Search

Instructions:
1. Compile: Run `clang++ exhaustive_search.cpp -o exhaustive`
2. Run: Use `./exhaustive < 1.in`, this is the supplied sample input. 

# Algorithm 2: Dynamic Programming

Instructions:
1. Compile: Run `clang++ dynamic.cpp -o dynamic` in the `/exhaustive_search` directory.
2. Run: Use `./dynamic < 1.in`, this is the supplied sample input.

# Alternatively:

1. Compile: You can compile both using `sh build.sh`
2. Run the Exhaustive Search version with `./exhaustive < 1.in`
3. Run the Dynamic Programming version with `./dynamic < 1.in`

# Empical Analysis:

To run the empirical analysis script, simply run `sh test.sh`
**NOTE: must compile cpp files before running this script**
This script just runs each executable using all 6 inputs each.
