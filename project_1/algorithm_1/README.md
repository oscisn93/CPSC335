# Algorithm 1: Greedy Approach to Hamilton Problem

There are a set of cities laid out in a circle and each has a gas station and a known distance between them. Assuming that you are in a car that can drive a certain number of miles per gallon, find the preferred starting city such you can complete the roundtrip without getting stuck in between cities (as for some reason the gas stations all have only a limited number of gallons of gallons of fuel).
The input consists of a set of distances between the cities, a set of fuel amounts available at each city, and the miles per gallon the car uses.
The distance corresponds to how far the current city is from the following one. Assume the gas is always adequate to complete a roundtrip and that there is always a preferred city such that the trip can be succesfully completed.
